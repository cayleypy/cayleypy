    Supported graphs:

      * "pancake" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=2), generated by reverses of all prefixes. It has n-1 generators denoted
          R1,R2..R(n-1), where Ri is reverse of elements 0,1..i. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_graph.
      * "burnt_pancake" - Cayley graph generated by reverses of all signed prefixes. Actually is a graph for
         S_2n (n>=1) representing a graph for n pancakes, where i-th element represents bottom side of i-th pancake,
         and (n+i)-th element represents top side of i-th pancake. The graph has n generators denoted R1,R2..R(n),
         where Ri is reverse of elements 0,1..i,n,n+1..n+i.
      * "full_reversals" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=2), generated by reverses of all possible substrings.
          It has n(n-1)/2 generators.
      * "lrx" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=3), generated by: shift left, shift right, swap first two elements.
      * "top_spin" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=4), generated by: shift left, shift right, reverse first four elements.
      * "cube_2/2/2_6gensQTM" - Schreier coset graph for 2x2x2 Rubik's cube with fixed back left upper corner and only
          quarter-turns allowed. There are 6 generators (front, right, down face - clockwise and counterclockwise).
      * "cube_2/2/2_9gensHTM" - same as above, but allowing half-turns (it has 9 generators).
      * "cube_3/3/3_12gensQTM" - Schreier coset graph for 3x3x3 Rubik's cube with fixed central pieces and only
          quarter-turns allowed. There are 12 generators (clockwise and counterclockwise rotation for each face).
      * "cube_3/3/3_18gensHTM" - same as above, but allowing half-turns (it has 18 generators).
      * "coxeter" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=2), generated by adjacent transpositions (Coxeter generators).
          It has n-1 generators: (0,1), (1,2), ..., (n-2,n-1).
      * "cyclic_coxeter" - Cayley graph for S_n (n>=2), generated by adjacent transpositions plus cyclic transposition.
          It has n generators: (0,1), (1,2), ..., (n-2,n-1), (0,n-1).
      * "mini_paramorphix" â€“ Cayley graph for a subgroup of S_24, acting on 24 titles. It is generated by 17 moves
          inspired by a simplified version of the Paramorphix puzzle. Moves are based on overlapping 2- and 3-cycles
