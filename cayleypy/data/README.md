Pre-computed results:
* `*_cayley_growth.csv` - growth function for various Cayley graphs. 
Key is size of permutations. 
Central state doesn't matter (but assumed to be the identity permutation).
* `*_coset_growth.csv` - growth functions for various Schreier coset graphs. 
Keys is the central states.
* `puzzles_growth.csv` - growth functions for puzzles (when it can be fully computed).
* `heisenberg_growth.csv` - growth function for Cayley group for Heisenberg group. 
Key is the modulo (under which matrix multiplication is done).
